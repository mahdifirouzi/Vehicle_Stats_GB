## Usage

### 1. Download and Extract Data
Run `download_extract.py` to download the NTS ZIP file and extract its contents into a folder named `NTS_updated` in the current directory.

```bash
python download_extract.py
```

### 2. Filter and Process ODS Files
Run `filter_ods_files.py` to filter ODS files by year and save the processed data to an Excel file.

```bash
python filter_ods_files.py
```

#### Customize Parameters
Modify the script to set:
- `sheet_to_file_map`: Maps sheet names to ODS filenames.
- `ods_directory`: Path to the directory containing ODS files.
- `output_file_prefix`: Prefix for the output Excel file.
- `year_to_filter`: Year to filter the data (e.g., `2023`).
